Copyright (C) 2024 Micropolis GmbH.</p><p>The name/term "MICROPOLIS" is a registered trademark owned by and exclusively licensed to Micropolis GmbH (Micropolis Corporation, the "licensor"). It is here (upstream) licensed to the authors/publishers of the "Micropolis" city simulation game and its source code (the project or "licensee(s)").</p><p>Your use of the GPL'ed source code under the name "MICROPOLIS" makes you a subsequent (downstream) licensee of the trademarked term "Micropolis" and binds you to the same terms as the original upstream authors/publishers of the project. These terms are:</p><ol><li>Give proper attribution. Copying, forking and or using the source code of the city simulation game under the name "Micropolis" requires you to include a trademark attribution on the main source code "welcome" page or on an obverse title page and in "credits" or wherever you acknowledge other trademarks and copyrights. This attribution requirement also applies when you use the original name in variation, with suffixes, prefixes or addenda (e.g., "MicropolisX", "Ymicropolis" or "Micropolis Z"). Attribution is also required when the trademark is used in works where the Micropolis project is covered, for example in blogs, online texts, scientific works etc.<br/><br/>A preferred attribution would be: "Micropolis is a registered trademark of Micropolis Corporation (Micropolis GmbH) and is licensed here as a courtesy of the owner under the Micropolis Public Name License." Where possible, activate this attribution with a link to <a href="https://www.micropolis.com">https://www.micropolis.com</a> and optionally to the license text.<br/><br/>Appropriately propagating the source code of the game requires the licensee to keep intact all notices stating that this agreement is in effect and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the code.</li><li>Acknowledge that the name "MICROPOLIS" is a commercial registered trademark. While the use of the bare source code is governed by GPL, the name of the open source project is a trademark owned by a single company within the community and the owner grants a revocable license for the name "MICROPOLIS" to you, the user, for non-commercial use in relation with the source code and game.<br/>This fact doesn't restrict software freedom or what you can do with the open source code. It only limits the use of the brand identifier. This is in order to enable co-existence under this name, separating the commercial realm from a free and open source city building game community and its activities.</li><li>Do not use the name "MICROPOLIS" in a way that creates confusion among consumers. Use of the name must remain closely related to the source code of the game. Its use must not disparage the licensor in its projects, e.g. through untruthful advertising, false or misleading promotional materials, etc. Do not use "MICROPOLIS" more prominently than your own company, product or service name. Do not use "MICROPOLIS" on posters, brochures, signs, websites, or other marketing materials to promote your events, products or services without written permission from the licensor. Do not refer to a product or service as being certified by, associated with or claim endorsement of, for or by the licensor. Do not attempt to claim or assert any ownership rights in the mark "MICROPOLIS" and do not attempt to register the term as a trademark, trade name, domain name, or "doing business as" name, alone or in combination with your own trademarks or addenda.<br/><br/>Apart from giving credit via the courtesy string wherever possible, the licensee agrees that use of the mark "MICROPOLIS" is done in a way that helps to mitigate confusion among consumers between the city simulator game and the licensor's products.</li><li>Usage in publishing. Do not use the term "MICROPOLIS" on the cover of a book or magazine without written permission from the licensor. You may not use the term "MICROPOLIS" in your own domain names, subdomains or as prominent account name on Internet platforms. This requirement also applies when you use the original name in variation, with suffixes, prefixes or addenda (e.g., "MicropolisX", "Ymicropolis" or "Micropolis Z"). You acknowledge that the use of the project's trademarked term "MICROPOLIS" in such a way is generally not "nominative fair use."</li><li>Trademark dilution bailout. In order to assess a possible future trademark dilution, the licensee agrees to cease use of the trademark in case the open source game project contributes, according to the opinion in public proceedings or in court, to a loss in distinctiveness of the licensor's mark.</li><li>Dispute resolution and jurisdiction. Court of jurisdiction is the Netherlands. Dispute resolution is favored to be handled through the European Union's dispute resolution board.<br/>Notwithstanding the immediate effect of this licensing document, a grace period of 90 days from the date of issuance is granted to all prior users of the "MICROPOLIS" trademark to achieve compliance with the terms and conditions herein.</li></ol><p>For more details, to request approvals or for explicit permissions, please contact the licensor, [Micropolis](https://www.micropolis.com/).</p><p>Amsterdam on October 1st, 2024.</p></div></main><footer id="licenseFooter" class="alignCenter chunk white padding10">Enjoyed micropolisJS? <a href="https://www.refuweegee.co.uk/your-donations">Click here to donate to a charity whose work I love!</a><div id="author" class="open">Brought to you by <a rel="author" href="http://www.graememcc.co.uk" target="_blank">Graeme McCutcheon</a><i><a rel="author" href="https://twitter.com/graememcc" target="_blank">(@graememcc)</a></i> and <a rel="author" href="https://github.com/graememcc/micropolisJS/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">contributors</a><div id="build">Build: f13a1624d111</div></div><div class="nameLicense">Micropolis is a registered trademark of <a href="https://www.micropolis.com">Micropolis Corporation (Micropolis GmbH)</a> and is licensed here as a courtesy of the owner under the <a href="name_license.html">Micropolis Public Name License</a>.</div></footer></body></html>
